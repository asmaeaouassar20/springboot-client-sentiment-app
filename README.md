# Spring Boot Client-Sentiment App

## Description
This is a basic Spring Boot project that provides CRUD operations for managing clients and sentiments.
It includes two main components:
- Client management
- Sentiment management (with positive and negative sentiment types)

## Future Improvements
- Add validation for inputs
- Implement security using Spring Security
- Enhance error handling with custom exceptions and error responses
  (implement error handling when trying to delete a client with associated sentiments in the DB)
- Add Unit and Integrayion Tests
- Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to better structure and manage incoming and outgoing data in the API.
